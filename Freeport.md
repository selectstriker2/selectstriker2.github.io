{} was born for the sea. The son of a tavern maid and an unknown sailor, he joined on as a cabin boy of the _Fortune's Mistress_ at age 8 after his mother's death.

He has spent the last 10 years trying to track down his father, with only a gem incrusted signet ring to guide him.

His last stint on the _Warden's Demise_ did not end well, as some of his fellow crew members framed hime for some petty theft and was forced to walk the plank.

He fully expected to die, adrift on the sea. He awoke on the sandy beaches near the town of __Falcon's Roost__ by a travelling priest.
