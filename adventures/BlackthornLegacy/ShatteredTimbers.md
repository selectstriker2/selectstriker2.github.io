# Shattered Timbers
## A 1 round Greyhawk Reborn Adventure set in the Gnarley Forest

### Blurb
With the ongoing construction projects in Dyvers, the continual supply of raw materials is vital to rebuilding Dyvers to its former glory. The last several shipments for the Greenwood Lumber Company are missing and their stockpile is dwindling. Can you help recover the missing shipments and reopen the logging trail, or will you be stopped by the denizens of the Gnarley Forest?
APL 2-4

## Overview
The party is meeting with Steven Andrews, a representative of the Greenwood Lumber Company. He is looking to hire adventurers to investigate several late shipments of lumber that were expected over a week ago.
Construction on several important buildings in Dyvers will soon be halted if the lumber is not received.

The party sets off from Dyvers to the village of Willowbend in the eastern Gnarley Forest, where they meet a squad of Gnarley Rangers coming back from the day's patrol.

### Willowbend

The Rangers can answer any questions the party might have regarding what is happening in the area. The lumber mill they are heading to is outside of what this squad has patrolled, but they can say that they have seen increased orc warband activity in the Gnarley as of late. One of the Rangers, Reyl Enthart, has been missing since last night and the rangers haven't had a chance to send a search party out to look for him.

The village of Willowbend is home to roughly 500 people, most of which are woodsmen, rangers, halfling & elven refugees from deeper in the Gnarley, and some craftsmen. The town is led by Mayor Melic Thistlecrown, an elven cleric of Celestian?

### Forest Patrols

The next morning the party sets off towards the lumber mill. They come across the remains of an orc hunting party that has been beset by some strange creature.
	
	1. If the group spends enough time investigating the carnage, the creature returns and attacks the party. It is a giant spider covered in a thick, black substance. The party can follow the spider back to a small cave, where it has brought several dead orcs, some woodsmen, and has poisoned a Ranger, who is currently unconcious.
	2. If the group continues on, they encounter another orc hunting party and can either fight, run away, or negotiate their surrender to the orcs. The orcs will flee back to the lumbermill if more than 50% of them are lost.

After the encounter, the party continues on to the lumber camp.

### Lumber Mill

The lumber camp has been taken over by a group of orcs, led by a bugbear named Gorshk. They have killed a good number of mill workers, and captured those that decided to surrender. They are on the defensive, as the giant spider has been spotted in the area and they have lost several orcs on patrol. 

The party has a number of ways to defeat the orcs
    * Pick them off in small numbers
    * Lead a frontal assault
    * Defeat the commander
    * Wait until the giant spider attacks the camp.

If the party has initiated combat and are looking to be victorious, either the giant spider or an orc patrol (if the spider has already been defeated) joins the fray to make things more exciting.

If the bugbear commander is defeated, the rest of the orcs will flee into the forest, letting out the occasional scream as some creature attacks them.
