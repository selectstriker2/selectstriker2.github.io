# Red Flags

Rumors of increased pirate activiy on the Nyr Dyv is spreading like wildfire around the Docks District, leaving merchants clamoring for additional protection and firepower. Seems like a good opportunity to make a bit of coin, don't you think?

## Encounter 1 Hands Needed!

> You have gotten word through the Dyvers Adventurer's Guild on a mercenary contract to help escort a small cog, the _Sapphire Star_, to the Shield Land city of _Admundfort_.
> Stories of fast ships with red flags attacking merchant ships on the Nyr Dyv over the last several months has many merchant comanies worried and willing to pay good coin to
> protect their shipments.

## Encounter 2 Morning Sea Breeze

> The morning of your departure is rather overcast, with a thick fog blanketing most of the Docks District. The shouts and clanging of the morning departures fills the otherwise still air.
> Your captain of the _Sapphire Star_, a burly Oriedian named Alistair Stormhaven, has welcomed you aboard and the first mate, a middle aged Oriedian man named Oscar Freld as shown you to
> where you will stay below decks when you are not on watch. After about half an hour, the ship is pushed back from the berth and begins to sail out of the harbor.

The morning portion of the voyage goes smoothly, and just as the crew stops to eat lunch the watchman in the crow's nest calls down about an incoming ship.

The _Dragon's Glimmer_ has hit a string of bad luck recently. The most recent being coming to close to a foreign ship as its rudder froze and they were unable to turn about. A small bolt of fire
was fired from the other ship at their sails, which immediately caught fire. The ship's main sail took significant damage and they've been moving at reduced speed for most of the night and morning.

After some negotiation, Alistair and the other captain have agreed to some trading of some merchandise for a spare sail. It takes an hour or so to replace the main sail, after which the ships will
part ways.

    If game time permits, some of the sailors of the _Dragon's Glimmer_ start a game of "Sailors Bones" and the party is welcomed to join if they want.

TODO add rules for "Sailor's Bones"

## Encoutner 3 A Night on Nyr Dyv

> After the day's encounter with the _Dragon's Glimmer_, the day crew is ready to settle down for the night as the evening crew takes the deck. A gentle breeze fills the sails, and several clouds slide
> in front of Celine and numerous stars in the dark black sky. Those of you that settle down for the night are lulled to sleep by a soft sea song sung by one of the older sailors.

> The calm of the early morning silence is suddenly broken as a loud thud is heard from the port side and shouts of "soul overboard!". The first mate is lowered down the side of the ship and pulls
> a young man from the cold water. As the two are hoisted up to deck the rest of the crew begins shining lanterns to the water's surface. Floating upon the water are the scorched remains of several
> sailors still clinging to what must at one time have been a small row boat.

The young man, Sean Taverdy, is unconcious from exhaustion. It takes over an hour for the boy to regain conciousness unless some form of magical healing is applied (possibly look at exhaustion rules).
Once he is concious he can tell the crew about the attack on the _Henrietta's Redemption_. A fast and small ship with blood red sails used the cover of the previous morning's fog to ambush them, at which point
the undermanned _Henrietta_ surrendered to a boarding party of all manner of orcs and an enormous half-orc missing his right eye. Some of the sailors managed to lower a small rowboat from the main deck and
attempted to escape, only to have a woman with flowing blonde hair and a blood red cape cast a massive ball of exploding fire on the fleeing sailors from the attacking ship. Sean heard the huge half orc yell
something about "slaves" at which point Sean managed to drop down into the water when no one was looking and swam to the remains of the rowboat. There he managed to keep afloat using the remnants of the rowboat
overnight, and managed into the morning before he became exhausted.
