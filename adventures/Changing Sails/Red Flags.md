# Red Flags

Rumors of increased pirate activiy on the Nyr Dyv is spreading like wildfire around the Docks District, leaving merchants clamoring for additional protection and firepower. Seems like a good opportunity to make a bit of coin, don't you think?

## Encounter 1 Hands Needed!

> You have gotten word through the Dyvers Adventurer's Guild on a mercenary contract to help escort a small cog, the _Sapphire Star_, to the Shield Land city of _Admundfort_.
> Stories of fast ships with red flags attacking merchant ships on the Nyr Dyv over the last several months has many merchant comanies worried and willing to pay good coin to
> protect their shipments.

## Encounter 2 Morning Sea Breeze

> The morning of your departure is rather overcast, with a thick fog blanketing most of the Docks District. The shouts and clanging of the morning departures fills the otherwise still air.
> Your captain of the _Sapphire Star_, a burly Oriedian named **Alistair Stormhaven**, has welcomed you aboard and the first mate, a middle aged Oriedian man named **Oscar Freld** shows you
> where you will stay below decks when you are not on watch. After about half an hour, the ship is pushed back from the berth and begins to sail out of the harbor.

There is another group of passengers that appear to be armed and armored. Their leader is is a half-elven woman named **Dawn Ammiter**. She is a member of the Dyvers Anti-Slavery League and is
actually on board to report and or stop any slaver activity they might encounter on the Nyr Dyv. The captain is aware of this, but keeps quiet about it until the meeting later.

The morning portion of the voyage goes smoothly, and just as the crew stops to eat lunch the watchman in the crow's nest calls down about an incoming ship.

The _Dragon's Glimmer_ has hit a string of bad luck recently. The most recent being coming to close to a foreign ship as its rudder froze and they were unable to turn about. A small bolt of fire
was fired from the other ship at their sails, which immediately caught fire. The ship's main sail took significant damage and they've been moving at reduced speed for most of the night and morning.

After some negotiation, **Alistair** and the other captain have agreed to some trading of some merchandise for a spare sail. It takes an hour or so to replace the main sail, after which the ships will
part ways.

>> If game time permits, some of the sailors of the _Dragon's Glimmer_ start a game of "Sailors Bones" and the party is welcomed to join if they want.

TODO add rules for "Sailor's Bones"

## Encoutner 3 A Night on Nyr Dyv

> After the day's encounter with the _Dragon's Glimmer_, the day crew is ready to settle down for the night as the evening crew takes the deck. A gentle breeze fills the sails, and several clouds slide
> in front of Celine and numerous stars in the dark black sky. Those of you that settle down for the night are lulled to sleep by a soft sea song sung by one of the older sailors.

> The calm of the early morning silence is suddenly broken as a loud thud is heard from the port side and shouts of "soul overboard!". The first mate is lowered down the side of the ship and pulls
> a young man from the cold water. As the two are hoisted up to deck the rest of the crew begins shining lanterns to the water's surface. Floating upon the water are the scorched remains of several
> sailors still clinging to what must at one time have been a small row boat.

The first mate brings the boy into the captains quarters. The party, along with **Dawn** are asked to
The young man, **Sean Taverdy**, is unconcious from exhaustion. If the party does not apply any magical healing to the boy, **Dawn** reaches down and lays her hands upon him, at which point he regains conciousness.
Once he is concious he can tell the captain and the party about the attack on the _Henrietta's Redemption_. A fast and small ship with blood red sails used the cover of the previous morning's fog to ambush them, at which point
the undermanned _Henrietta_ surrendered to a boarding party of all manner of orcs and an enormous half-orc missing his right eye. Some of the sailors managed to lower a small rowboat from the main deck and
attempted to escape, only to have a woman with flowing black hair and a blood red cape cast a massive ball of exploding fire on the fleeing sailors from the attacking ship. **Sean** heard the huge half orc yell
something about "slaves" at which point **Sean** managed to drop down into the water when no one was looking and swam to the remains of the rowboat. There he managed to keep afloat using the remnants of the rowboat
overnight, and managed into the morning before he became exhausted.
After recounting the events of the attack, **Sean** begins to grow weary and falls asleep on the small chair in the captain's room.

With the boy asleep, **Dawn** presents the captain with a unique request.

> As you may know Alistair, these slavers may still be in the area, which presents us with a unique opportunity. My sources have only been able to approximate the area they have been operating out of, but our current position
> and the boy's account leaves only two places they could be. If the rest of your guards are willing, we should strike them now while they would not be expecting us and deliver a severe blow to these slavers' operations.
> She looks to your group - "What say you?"

+ If the group refuses to save the crew and passengers of the _Henrietta_, **Dawn** will be dismayed but knows she cannot hope to stop the slavers with her group alone. The ship continues on to _Admundfort_, and the party gains
    the disfavor of the DASL.
+ If the group inquires about what pay they might receive, she will offer 25 GP per party member that assists.
+ If the group agrees without being too greedy, they will still receive 25 GP per party member, as well as the favor of the DASL at the completion of the mission.

## Encounter 4 Chase the Red Flag

> With the setting sun your ship approaches a small island. A small, sleek ship is anchored just off shore, along with a ship fitting the description of _Henrietta's Redemption_.

## Encounter 5 Hint of What's to Come
