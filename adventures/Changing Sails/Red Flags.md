# Red Flags

Rumors of increased pirate activiy on the Nyr Dyv is spreading like wildfire around the Docks District, leaving merchants clamoring for additional protection and firepower. Seems like a good opportunity to make a bit of coin, don't you think?

## Encounter 1 Hands Needed!

> You have gotten word through the Dyvers Adventurer's Guild on a mercenary contract to help escort a small cog, the _Sapphire Star_, to the Shield Land city of _Admundfort_.
> Stories of fast ships with red flags attacking merchant ships on the Nyr Dyv over the last several months has many merchant comanies worried and willing to pay good coin to
> protect their shipments.

## Encounter 2 Morning Sea Breeze

> The morning of your departure is rather overcast, with a thick fog blanketing most of the Docks District. The shouts and clanging of the morning departures fills the otherwise still air.
> Your captain of the _Sapphire Star_ has welcomed you aboard and the first mate, a middle aged Oriedian man named Oscar Freld as shown you to where you will stay below decks when you are not
> on watch. After about half an hour, the ship is pushed back from the berth and begins to sail out of the harbor.

The morning portion of the voyage goes smoothly, and just as the crew stops to eat lunch the watchman in the crow's nest calls down about an incoming ship.

The _Dragon's Glimmer_ has hit a string of bad luck recently. The most recent being coming to close to a foreign ship as its rudder froze and they were unable to turn about. A small bolt of fire
was fired at their sails, which immediately caught fire.


## Encoutner 3 A Night on Nyr Dyv

> After the day's encounter with the stranded ship, the day crew is ready to settle down for the night as the evening crew takes the deck. A gentle breeze fills the sails, and several clouds slide
> in front of Celine and numerous stars in the dark black sky. Those of you that settle down for the night are lulled to sleep by a soft sea song sung by one of the older sailors.

> The calm of the early morning silence is suddenly broken as a loud thud is heard from the port side and shouts of "soul overboard!". The first mate is lowered down the side of the ship and pulls
> a young man from the cold water. As the two are hoisted up to deck the rest of the crew begins shining lanterns to the water's surface. Floating upon the water are the scorched remains of several
> sailors still clinging to what must at one time have been a small row boat.
