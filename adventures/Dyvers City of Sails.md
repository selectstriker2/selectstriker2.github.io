### The Peerless Pier

A popular inn and tavern that the wealthier merchants stay when arriving in Dyvers.

### The Rusty Scab

A tavern frequented by the most unruly and cuthroat sailors on shore leave.
Run by a stern old sailor "Longpick" and his portly wife "Sharon", this establishment
is a good place to conduct unsavory business.

It is commonly believed that the Alliance works through a good number of the individuals that own property here.
