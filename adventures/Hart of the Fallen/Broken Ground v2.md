# Blurb

Numerous disapperances near the currently under construction Temple of Celestian in the Free City of Dyvers have the
locals on edge and further construction on the temple has been halted. Can you uncover the evil afoot and put a
stop to the disapperances?

An introductory adventure for characters level 1-4 set within the Free City of Dyvers

# Background

> With the horde of the Pomarj thrown free of the city and back into the Gnarley, there exists only a single moment
to breathe a sigh of relieve before the push is on to rebuild and restore the once glimmering City of Sails.
Now, it wouldn't be Dyvers without the opportunity to rise above one's station, whether in wealth, influence, or power.
The turmoil is surely being observed by those in Greyhawk, and the surrounding region.

# Adventure
## Encounter 1 Community in Need

> The streets of Dyvers have always been somewhat dangerous, but word of disapperances near the Temple of Celestian,
currently under construction, has left this street nearly deserted as you approach The Miner's Flask. Hopefully
your meeting with the cleric of Celestian hasn't been cancelled.

The party has found themselves meeting with Jelkar Fern, a priest to Celestian and person in charge of handling the
construction of the new temple. The meeting has been set up in a bar (The Miner's Flask) near the temple construction site.

Jelkar Fern is a middle aged man with dark brown hair and steel eyes. He walks with a slight limp and wears robes of milky black
embroidered with silver stars.

He stands up and greets the players as they enter the tavern, motioning to the bartender for a round of drinks.

> Thanks for meeting with me, I haven't had much success in getting interest in my resolving the current disapperances. Won't
you please sit down while I order us some drinks.

> Last week the construction crew uncovered a stone door buried beneath the rubble of the building we are looking
to turn into our temple. I inspected the door but could not find any way to open it. I sought out help from the local
guilds to open it but everyone has been too busy.

> Several nights ago several of the local townsfolk disappeared and haven't been heard from since. I'm worried it may be
somehow related to our discovery, but I don't have the faintest clue as to how.
was called to inspect the stone door. When he returned the following morning the stone door was cast aside and obvious
disturbances on the ground were found. Jelkar entered the crypt below, felt unnerved, and immediately sought out help
from adventurers.

Things Jelkar knows:
- Several people have been reported missing in the area over the last two days
- He can offer each character 5 gp if they will investigate the crypt and an additional 20 gp each if they can find any evidence
  as to what is causing the disapperances.
- construction workers did indicate a slight chill and a somewhat unsettling feeling the last night they were at the site
- the missing people don't seem to have any common pattern
    - Bev Delm - a seamstress with a shop down the road
    - Milton Trelmar - a local ladies man and frequenter of the tavern
    - Allan and Crist Nettleworth - visting merchants looking to open a shop in the area.

## Encounter 2 Investigate the Temple Construction Site

The excavation site consists of a lot roughly 50' x 80' with a 30'x 50' ruined two story building. A 5' wide ramp leads up what used to be the front steps.

Proceeding towards the back of the building shows some reinforced steps leading down into a shallow basement. Exploring the ruins is relatively safe.
This building used to be a small theater. The roof looks to have been blown completely off and much of the interior is charred.

Freshly uncovered in the basement under the stage is a carved stone slab with a single symbol carved into the top.

__Symbol is of a

Any attempt to move the door takes a DC 17 strength(athletics) check.
The door is trapped, with a disable switch located on the back wall behind some brickwork.
It can be noticed with a DC 15 Wisdom(Perception) check or the trap can be manually disabled with a DC 17 Thieves Tools check.

Setting off the trap yields a blast of necrotic energy in a 20' radius.

## Encounter 3 Into the Unburied Crypt

> Removing the stone slab, you see a small passage way lead down into the darkness. The stairs continue for another
> 15 feet before opening up into a small 20' x 20' room. Rotten wood doors are centered on the left and right walls,
> with a small stone lecturn standing 15' in front of you. Tattered tapestries adorn the walls, depicting various scenes
> of burial rites. Several armored skeletons can be seen standing in several small alcoves along the far wall.

The skeletons animate once someone approaches the lecturn or opens either door. If the players attack from a distance
one will be destroyed and then the rest will animate.

HP 16, AC 14, Longsword +3 1d8+2

__Armored Advanced Skeltons__

A secret door sits in the far wall behind the lectern. It can be noticed with a DC 15 Wis(Perception) check or a DC 13 Int(Investigation) check.

## Encounter 4 The Smell of Undead

This chamber has 4 clusters of sarcophogi, each with a child sized sarcophogus.

> As you open the rotted wooden door you see what looks to be a burial crypt. The stale smell of death permeates the room, and a small
> orb hung in the center of the room gives off a pale green glow. A small sarcophogi rests in each corner of the room.

## Encounter 5 A Lost Knight

> This small cavern looks to have been used as a store room some time ago. Broken crates and barrels line the southern wall, and a
> large pool of stagnant water sits alongside the northern wall. The air is stale with the smell of old ale and salty brine.

The pool of water has slowly filled up in this room, providing a small walkway along the southern wall. No one has been down here
in almost 5 years. The vampire hunter "Ravenwood" had tracked down one of the youngest vampires in an ancient family and was killed
in the confrontation. His arm was severed as he died, transferring his soul into the ring.

_Grey Ooze_
The grey ooze in this room entered a through small crack some time ago.

_The Ring_
NOTE If the players do not investigate the pool of water to find the ring, they will find it on the shaman in the next encounter.

> You find an expertly crafted platinum ring with the holy symbol of Heironious embedded into it. As you pick it up, you are
washed over with a sense of purpose.

> Upon putting the ring on you get a sense that you aren't alone anymore. A voice in your head sounds out in a charasmatic voice:
> Thanks for recovering

One of the players will discover the ring, whether by intention or sheer dumb luck. The Ring of Mind Shielding currently
has a protected soul in it, that of "Commander Ravenwood", a deceased Knight of the Hart tracking a family of vampires that were
living in the sewers some time ago. They found him and killed him, not knowing that his ring would grant him the ability
exist on mentally. He is unsure of how long he has been maintained in the ring, but has some ideas on how to free him from it.


## Encounter 6 Entering The Sewers

> Proceeding beyond the small cavern, you find yourself heading down a short hallway, with a solid stone door at the end.
> Hinged and locked from this side, it looks like someone has been through here recently.

While the door is locked from this side, the door is trapped and goes off if someone opens the door without pressing a small
button 10 feet down the hallway.

## Encounter 7 Journal of a Madman

> As you push the door open the strong smell of putrid sewage hits your nostrils. The space beyond is roughly 25 x 50 feet
> and you immediately notice the denizens of this room.
> Atop what looks to be a large packing crate, a large goblin adorned in the dress of a shaman holds a tattered leather book
> above his head. His followers bark and yip in excitement. [Goblin] "Veshka has warned us of interlopers, we must defend our temple."
