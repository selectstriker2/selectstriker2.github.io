## Encounter 1 Community in Need

The party has found themselves meeting with Jelkar Fern, a priest to Celestian and person in charge of handling the
construction of the new chapel. The meeting has been set up in a conference room at the Dyvers Adventurer's Guildhall.

Several days ago the excavation crew uncovered a stone door buried in the earth. Excavation was halted and Jelkar Fern
was called to inspect the stone door. When he returned the following morning the stone door was cast aside and obvious
disturbances on the ground were found. Jelkar entered the crypt below, felt unnerved, and immediately sought out help
from adventurers.

Several people have been reported missing in the area over the last two days and Jelkar fears they might be related
to the crypt.

He offers each character 5 gp if they will investigate the crypt and an additional 20 gp if they can find any evidence
as to what is causing the disapperances.

## Encounter 2 Investigate the Excavation Site

The excavation site consists of a 5' deep hole roughly 30' x 80'. A 10' wide ramp leads along the north (street) wall.
The excavated stone stairs and doorway are roughly 20' from the rear wall and goes another 5' down.

A thin green mist has collected in the depression and obscures the surface. Various tools can be seen around the site.
The gas is both poisonous and explosive, requiring anyone entering the site to cover their mouths and put out any flame.
The gas is coming out of an old sewer pipe near the western wall. This pipe can be noticed with a DC 17 Perception check
and blocked off by any number of means. If it is blocked off, Area X in the sewer tunnels will become full of the gas.

    An spells that generate heat cause an explosion of 1d12/2d12/4d12 and consume the gas for the area of the spell
    plus 5 feet in each dimension.

    Anyone breathing the gas must make a DC 12 CON save or be poisoned for 1d4 minutes

Party gains experience by avoiding or clearing the poisonous gas.

## Encounter 3 Into the Unburied Crypt

> Entering the stone doorway, you see a small passage way lead down into the darkness. The stairs continue for another
> 15 feet before opening up into a small 20' x 20' room. Rotten wood doors are centered on the left and right walls,
> with a small stone lecturn standing 15' in front of you. Tattered tapestries adorn the walls, depicting various scenes
> of burial rites. Several armored skeletons can be seen standing in several small alcoves along the far wall.

The skeletons animate once someone approaches the lecturn or opens either door. If the players attack from a distance
one will be destroyed and then the rest will animate.

## Encounter 5 A Lost Knight

> This small cavern looks to have been used as a store room some time ago. Broken crates and barrels line the southern wall, and a
> large pool of stagnant water sits alongside the northern wall. The air is stale with the smell of old ale and salty brine.

The pool of water has slowly filled up in this room, providing a small walkway along the southern wall. No one has been down here
in almost 5 years. The vampire hunter "Ravenwood" had tracked down one of the youngest vampires in an ancient family and was killed
in the confrontation. His arm was severed as he died, transferring his soul into the ring.

_Grey Ooze_
The grey ooze in this room entered a through small crack some time ago.

_The Ring_

One of the players will discover the ring, whether by intention or sheer dumb luck. The Ring of Mind Shielding currently
has a protected soul in it, that of "Commander Ravenwood" a deceased Knight of the Hart tracking a family of vampires that were
living in the sewers some time ago. They found him and killed him, not knowing that his ring would grant him the ability
exist on mentally. He is unsure of how long he has been maintained in the ring, but has some ideas on how to free him from it.

## Encounter 6 Entering The Sewers

> Proceeding beyond the small cavern, you find yourself heading down a short hallway, with a solid stone door at the end.
> Hinged and locked from this side, it looks like someone has been through here recently.

While the door is locked from this side, the door is trapped and goes off if someone opens the door without pressing a small
button 10 feet down the hallway.

## Encounter 7 Journal of a Madman

> As you push the door open the strong smell of putrid sewage hits your nostrils. The space beyond is roughly 25 x 50 feet
> and you immediately notice the denizens of this room.
> Atop what looks to be a large packing crate, a large goblin adorned in the dress of a shaman holds a tattered leather book
