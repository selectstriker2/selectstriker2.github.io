## Encounter 1 Community in Need

The party has found themselves meeting with Jelkar Fern, a priest to Celestian and person in charge of handling the construction of the new chapel.
The meeting has been set up in a conference room at the Dyvers Adventurer's Guildhall.

Several days ago the excavation crew uncovered a stone door buried in the earth. Excavation was halted and Jelkar Fern was called to inspect the stone door.
When he returned the following morning the stone door was cast aside and obvious disturbances on the ground were found. Jelkar entered the crypt below, felt unnerved, and immediately sought out help from adventurers.

Several people have been reported missing in the area over the last two days and Jelkar fears they might be related to the crypt.

He offers each character 5 gp if they will investigate the crypt and an additional 20 gp if they can find any evidence as to what is causing the disapperances.

## Encounter 2 Investigate the Excavation Site

The excavation site consists of a 5' deep hole roughly 30' x 80'. A 10' wide ramp leads along the north (street) wall. The excavated stone stairs and doorway are roughly 20' from the rear wall and goes another 5' down.
A thin green mist has collected in the depression and obscures the surface. Various tools can be seen around the site. The gas is both poisonous and explosive, requiring anyone entering the site to cover their mouths
and put out any flame. The gas is coming out of an old sewer pipe near the western wall. This pipe can be noticed with a DC 17 Perception check and blocked off by any number of means. If it is blocked off,
Area X in the sewer tunnels will become full of the gas.

    An spells that generate heat cause an explosion of 1d12/2d12/4d12 and consume the gas for the area of the spell plus 5 feet in each dimension.

    Anyone breathing the gas must make a DC 12 CON save or be poisoned for 1d4 minutes

Party gains experience by avoiding or clearing the poisonous gas.

## Encounter 3 Into the Unburied Crypt

> Entering the stone doorway, you see a small passage way lead down into the darkness. The stairs continue for another 15 feet before opening up into a small 20'x20' room. Rotten wood doors are centered on the left and right
> walls, with a small stone lecturn standing 15' in front of you. Tattered tapestries adorn the walls, depicting various scenes of burial rites. Several armored skeletons can be seen standing in several small alcoves along
> the far wall.

The skeletons animate once someone approaches the lecturn or opens either door. If the players attack from a distance one will be destroyed and then the rest will animate.
