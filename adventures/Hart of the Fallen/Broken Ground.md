## Encounter 1 Community in Need

The party has found themselves meeting with Jelkar Fern, a priest to Celestian and person in charge of handling the construction of the new chapel.
The meeting has been set up in a conference room at the Dyvers Adventurer's Guildhall.

Several days ago the excavation crew uncovered a stone door buried in the earth. Excavation was halted and Jelkar Fern was called to inspect the stone door.
When he returned the following morning the stone door was cast aside and obvious disturbances on the ground were found. Jelkar entered the crypt below, felt unnerved, and immediately sought out help from adventurers.

Several people have been reported missing in the area over the last two days and Jelkar fears they might be related to the crypt.

He offers each character 5 gp if they will investigate the crypt and an additional 20 gp if they can find any evidence as to what is causing the disapperances.
