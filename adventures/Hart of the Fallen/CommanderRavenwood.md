# Commander Ravenwood

Commander Jordannus Ravenwood was a Paladin of Heironious that escaped capture by the Temple of Elemental Evil back in CY 573 with a Ring of Mind Shielding.

From there he escaped north east into the Gnarley Forest, where he was set upon by a band of wandering orcs. He managed to defeat them but was severly wounded.
Several hours later a Gnarley Ranger scouting party found him, brought him to the nearby ranger outpost, and nursed him back to health. His recovery left him
with some lost After helping the
rangers dispatch some other humanoids, he made his way to the city of Dyvers.

In the Free City of Dyvers he served the Cathedral of Heironious (CY 574-597) when he then retired from regular duties. He still helps out with general
divine duties and operates as an emissary to other temples and political events.
