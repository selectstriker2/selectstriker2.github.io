He has enthralled several young women and lured them to a small farmstead outside of town.

# Adventure Synopsis

## Encounter 1 Request from the Cathedral of Pelor

A request for aid has come from the Church of Pelor in Dyvers after several gruesome murders have taken place over the last couple weeks in Maraven. The party has been hired for a sum of 25 GP each to meet with the Maraven Watch Commander and aid him in his investigation.

## Encounter 2 A Missing Watch

When the party arrives at the Maraven Watch Commander's office the following morning a briefing is just concluding covering a murder the previous night.

After discussing with the Watch Commander, the party is allowed to investigate the crime scene. The scene is rather gruesome, with blood sprayed everywhere. The watchman's body is slashed from multiple directions, and further inspection reveals human bite marks on his arms, with small bits of flesh torn out.

Clues to find:
    + Talking with other watchmen, the victim was meeting with a young lady before his shift at the Lion's Rampart.
    + A small note with flowing script in the victim's belt pouch with the message "Let's meet after your shift - Liz"

## Encounter 3 Run in with the Alliance

While investigating the murdered city watchman, the party gets stopped by a member of the Infiltrators Guild __Nightshade__, who is also looking into the death of the watchman as he was a low ranking Enforcer's Guild member. When she determines that the death was not the work of another guild and something else, she leaves them to deal with the mess.

If the party attempts to attack Nightshade, she will misty step away and report back to her guild the group can not be trusted. (Disfavor of the Alliance)

If the party manages to kill Nightshade before she can escape, a bounty is put on the group for their capture/death. They spend the rest of the adventure trying to clear their name.

## Encounter 4 A Wolf in Lions Clothing

The investigation leads to a local tavern, The Lion's Rampart, where the watchman was seen before going on his shift.
Here the party is watched by one of the ladies that has been charmed by the young vampire. As they begin to ask questions she approaches the party to try to provide some disinformation to the group, before leaving to inform her master.

The group are able to acertain that an unusual traveller arrived several weeks ago and occasionally visits the tavern.
He has creeped out several patrons but the owner hasn't been brave enough to ask him to leave. He has been spotted around some homes on the western outskirts of town.

## Encounter 5 Darkness of the Gnarley

The trek out to the farmstead takes about 30 minutes, and the weather takes a sudden turn for the worse, as a thunderstorm blows in from the west.

### Dark Wolves

> A summer storm is blowing in from the west. As the party sees the farmstead off in the distance the sound of howling is heard on the wind.
