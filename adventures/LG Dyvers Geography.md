Dyvers is centrally located- just West of the city of Greyhawk, South of Furyondy and North of the Wild Coast. Its' location at the mouth of the Verdandya River allows trade both up the river and onto the Nyr Dyv.


The Nyr Dyv:
This great lake, also known as the Lake of Unknown Depths, is a strategic body of water. Across it, much trade is plied between Greyhawk, Dyvers, Furyondy, Urnst, and the lands beyond as fas as Perrenland and the Theocracy. Many major ports and navigable inlets and outlets throng the waters of the Nyr Dyv. The navies of Furyondy and Urnst still dominate this great lake, protecting the shipping that travels it; Iuz has not yet sought to extend any naval strength to the Nyr Dyv.

The Nyr Dyv is home to both the Rhennee and many monsters. Freshwater serpents and octopi have often been reported, as have freshwater aquatic umber hulks and worse. A notable feature of a more pleasant aspect is a large community of selkie off the coast of Oldred, who do their best to warn sailors of possible hazards of this type. The selkie are known to be unfriendly towards Rhennee. 

Velverdyva River
Rising from Lake Quag, the Velverdyva is the busiest trade river in the Flanaess. It flows through Perrenland, the lands of the Highfolk, through Veluna and the trade cities of Verbobonc and Dyvers, and into the Nyr Dyv. It is navigable for virtually all its length, cutting sharp but broad-bottomed river valleys in the western Yatils. Its tributary, the Fals, is navigable to Thornwood, so that trade from Ket also runs into the Velverdyva. The Att tributary of Furyondy is navigable well beyond Littleburg.

The broad plains on the banks of the lowland Velverdyva are fertile, and the fishing in this river and its tributaries is good, with many fish spawning in the Quag and heading to the Nyr Dyv for maturity (or the many fishing nets that await them). 

Gnarley Forest
Parts of this legendary forest are claimed by Celene, Greyhawk, Dyvers, and Verbobonc. However, the inhabitants of these woodlands are free-spirited folk, so no formal government is ever likely to hold sway as long as there are deep woods to shelter resisters. The Viscount of Verbobonc is well liked by the folk dwelling in northeastern portions of the Gnarley, while the Queen of Celene is favored by those in the south. The forest is home to many fierce creatures as well, and many humanoid bands rove about seeking to murder and loot. These invaders work their way up from the Pomarj, through the Suss and Welkwood. Some come via the mountains and hills from the north.

A place of wooded glades and peaceable hillfolk, gnomes and elves, but also great danger, the Gnarley Forest is an exciting adventuring milieu. The Gnarlye Forest is an ancient forest full of immense trees. In most places, the tree canopy blocks out most light, resulting in little ground vegetation, makin gthe forest floor easy to walk. These areas are almost like parkland, save for the presence of much rotted timber and trees felled by age or storm scattered across the ground.

Only a small portion of the Gnarley is claimed by Greyhawk. The great bulk of the forest, lying, westward, is claimed by Celene, although Dyvers lays claim to some northern fringes of the forest as does Verbobonc to the west. Celene protects its borders fairly zealously and lays claim to virtually oall of the Welkwood to the south (and all lands east of the jewel river). There is no formal boundary between the lands of Dyvers and those of Grethawk.

Greyhawk exacts little in the way of tax or tithe from the Gnarley, save from the frontier villages close to the Plains of Greyhawk and the Wild Coast. Rather, its militias patrol in order to make friends among the folk of the forest and to watch for Pomarj invaders heading northward.

To the west, a great central swath of the forest consists of wooded hill land, where the eastern spur of the Kron Hills enters the Gnarley. Tree cover here is rather less dense and there are many secluded, fertile glades and valleys. The hills rise gently, with long, stretching undulations growing steeper as they rise to the west.

The Gnarley hills have fairly poor mineral resources in the area, although a handful of mines within 20 miles or so of Namburil yield chrysoberyls and peridots, together with some fine quartz and tiger eye agates. Most of the superior gems are found in the west.

The Gnarley is surpassingly old. In its deepest recesses, treants and hostile lyrannikin repel those not of the fores themselves. There is an almost tangible aura of magic in such places, and the faerie folk and elves here do not welcome intruders, no matter what their intentions. Likwise, some buried secrets in the Gnarley are of great antiquity, and righ with the history of Oerik- and, not rarely, redolent of its greates evils to boot. 




Free and Independent City of Dyvers
Ruler: Her Excellency Larissa Hunter, the Magister of Dyvers
Population: 52,000 (city)
Demi-humans: Some
Humanoids: Few
Resources: shipbuilding supplies, foodstuffs, clothing

Dyvers was originally a city within Furyondy, an important trading center with the lake and river traffic from Bissel, Nyrond, Urnst, and even lands as far away as Perrenland (down the Velverdyva River) and the Theocracy of the Pale. Dyvers proclaimed itself a free city in 526 CY, alleging that it was uncomfortable with Furyondy allying with a state whose policies Dyvers found overly restrictive (i.e., Veluna). This was propably just a pretext, but King Thrommel II of Furyondy allowed the secession to pass in return for Dyvers continuing to contribute taxes and levies to Furyondian coffers.

Dyvers lays claim to some 2,000 square miles of territory along the south bank of the Velverdyva to the Gnarley Forest. It also claims a number of small islands at the mouth of the great river, which are heavily wharfed and warehoused and form the center of the River Quarter of the city. Its rulers are drawn by meritocratic vote from mages, scholars, experienced warriors, and priests.

Dyvers has a somewhat declining income from trade, but its fishing vessels still capture good harvests of gar, pike, and a golden, carplike fish from the Nyr Dyv. Its influx of refugees has been a mixed blessing. Many mercenaries come to Dyvers seeking employment, and some skilled people fave settled here. On the other hand, in the poorer qusrters of the city, many Shield Landers (among others) have sought refuge, and overcrowding is now a major problem. Not unnaturally, Dyversians blame the incomers for an epidemic outbreak of a typhuslike illness which killed nearly a thousand folk shortly after the Shield Landers's mass influx from Admundfort.

Internecine assaults and murders are not unusual. The constables of the Watch, famous for their ostentatious insignia and the flashy epaulettes of their officers, often have their work cut out maintaining peace. At least Dyvers' army and militias have been strengthened by recruitment from the best of the Shield Landers, and a handful of good warriors have fled here from conquered lands of the west (Bissel, Geoff, Sterich).

Dyvers has something of a rivalry with Greyhawk City, since their territories now overlap to the east. Dyvers looks upon Greyhawk's expansion with some ill ease.

Other Cities
Well, there are Caltaran and Maraven, but who cares? They aren't Dyvers! 

Kingdom of Furyondy:
Ruler: His Pious Majesty, King Belvor IV
Capital: Chendl (pop. 13,000)
Population: 360,000
Races: Oeridian, suel, baklunish
Demi-humans: Elves (4,500), some others
Humanoids: Doubtful
Resources: foodstuffs, cloth, gold

Transformed nearly 350 years ago from a Viceroyalty under Aerdy rule to an independent nation, Furyondy is a fertile land but one which has suffered greatly in the Wars. Some northern territory has been lost to Iuz, and Chendl is still being rebuilt after its seige, using resources this impoverished land can barely afford. Much of its naval power was lost on the Whyestil Lake, although from Willip, a goodly remnant sails the Nyr Dyv. It suffered grievous loss of manpower during the battles against Iuz, although it has been reinforced by Shield Landers who fled here when their homeland fell.

King Belvor IV must manage a balancing act, given the divisions of the seven noble houses of the kingdom. The northern nobles have been bled dry by the wars and desperately need money and men. The southern nobles resent the heavy taxes, even though they know they must pay them, and they are suspicious of excessive influence on Belvor from several quarters: from Veluna, which has a powerful say in Furyondian affairs given its greater strength; from the militaristic Knight of the Hart (sustained by the northern nobles) who urge a revenge campaign on Iuz; from the ambassador of the Highfolk, allied with Furyondy during the wars; and from those Vesve folk whose infantry similarly allied with the kingdom. Most of Furyondy's residual army strength comes from veterans and levies raised by these nobles, and the King has no money to pay for mercenaries. Belvor feels his difficulties keenly and longs to rebuild his land, which he loves deeply. He is known to finance speculative quests from his own monies.

Yet even in such difficult times, ordinary Furyondians are good-natured, kindly people, sunny of disposition and not insular as so many others are (though those close to the borders with Iuz are less trusting). They understand the need for rebuilding and protection and pay veru heavy taxes willingly. Most believe war will come again, within a decade, and this time it will be a fight to the finish. They are prepared to work hard and sacrifice all to that end. Furyondy is a land with a glorious past, and its people do not forget this



Free City of Greyhawk:
Ruler: His Solemn Authority, the Lord Mayor of Greyhawk, Nerof Gasgal
Population: 58,000 (city)
Demi-humans: Some
Humanoids: Some
Resources: silver, electrum, gold, platinum, variety of gems

Greyhawk was established as a trading post on the Selintan River during the period of early migrations. As it flourished, a local warlord built a small keep on the hills above the village called Greyhawk which had sprung up around the trading center, extracting taxes from the trade and occasionally raiding caravans (particularly those coming with silver ingots found in the burial mounds of the Cairn Hills). This petty noble soon became quite rich and powerful and assumed the title of Landgraf of Selintan. Greyhawk and the power of the new Landgraf grew rapidly thereafter, and his son and heir, Ganz, was wed to the daughter of the Gynarch (Despotrix) of Hardby, a sorceress of no small repute. Their descendants ruled a growing domain which rose to considerable heights c. 375 CY under the rule of Zagig Yragerne (the so-called Mad Archmage). It was Zagig who built the sprawling Castle Greyhawk (now a ruin) and poured funds into the City of Greyhawk in order to make it into the "Gem of the Flanaess." His reign was bizarre in many other ways, and it came as no surprise when it was reported that Zagig Yragerne had mysteriously vanished after years of rule when no change or aging could be detected. The castle was abandoned, supposedly due to a terrible curse upon the place, but the City proper continued to flourish. In 498 CY it was proclaimed a free and independent city, ruling a territory from Hardby on the Woolly bay to the Nyr Dyv, between the eastern folds of the Cairn Hills and the Gnarley forest, including much of what is now the northern section of the Wild Coast region. These holdings have been lost over the intervening decades, and a decline in trade seemed certain to turn the place into a backwater, save for recent events. Several years ago a series of treasure troves was discovered in or near Greyhawk Castle. Immense wealth began flowing into the city, and artisans and mercenaries began flocking to Greyhawk due to this boom. Local lords used this influx of hard money to revitalize the city, and it again rules a considerable portion of the area, claiming all of the land from Nyr Dyv to the Neen River where it joins the Selintan, including the mines in the Cairn Hills.

Greyhawk is ruled by its Lord Mayor; this individual is chosen by the Directing Oligarchy. The latter body is composed of the Captain-General of the Watch, the Constable, the Guildmaster of Thieves, the Guildmaster of Assassins, and various representatives of the Society of Magi, the Merchants and Traders Union, Artisans League, and Clerical leaders. The total number of the Directors ranges from 12 to 18.



Viscounty and Free Town of Verbobonc:
Ruler: His Lordship, Viscount Wilfrick of Verbobonc
Population: 12,500 (city)
Demi-humans: Gnomes (4,000), Sylvan Elves (2,500)
Humanoids: Few
Resources: copper, gems

Verbobonc is now considered a free city, although technically it has a viscounty whose writ runs some 15 miles into the Kron Hills. Since the Wars, Verbobonc has all but abandoned its responsibilities in the hills, and the gnomes there have looked elsewhere for their alliances and protection. Verbobonc's influence over its small satellite villages has also declined, with village elders and rulers being allowed free rein to rule.

Viscount Wilfrick grows old, and a city that once maintained a powerful militia and a neverending watch against evil, especially the Gnarley Forest and the dread Temple of Elemental Evil, has grown tired along with him. It is entirely plausible that Scarlet Brotherhood agents and "advisers" have counseled the Viscount to sit tight in troubled times. The construction of a castle at the village of Hommlet is deemed to have been sufficient effort, and Verbobonc washes its hands of further watchfulness.

The ordinary folk of the town continue their trading much as before. The humans and gnomes who populate it are cheerful, kindly folk who smile away tales of the Wars with mumbled comments of "oh, that's terrible."

If there is still vigilance and strength in Verbobonc, it resides in a handful of rulers of local towns and fortifications, several of whom are known to have meetings with Furyondian representatives and members of the Knights of the Hart. It may well be that determined effort will be made by these people to formally align Verbobonc with Furyondy and Velune, states which gratefully received volunteer Verbobonc warriors during the Wars.



Free Cities of Wild Coast:
Rulers: Military councils of Greyhawk
Population: Narwell 3,600; Safeton 5,500
Demi-humans: Many
Humanoids: Many
Resources: None outstanding

The three southern cities of the Wild Coast fell to Turrosh Mak's Pomarj humanoids during the Wars. The fact that the two northernmost cities did not also fall can only be put down to the humanoids switching their attentions, and forces, westward to Ulek rather than pressing home the attack here. The Free City of Greyhawk now has much greater say here.
