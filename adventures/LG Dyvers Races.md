Background
Demihumans
Habits of the demihuman races are another matter. As one would expect, elven folk are found in woodland and forest, dwarves in hills and mountains, and so on. Demihumans are also drawn generally to major Free Cities such as Dyvers and Greyhawk. And there are certain lands in which demihumans are of major importance. The major elf-ruled lands are those of Celene (gray and wood elves), the Duchy of Ulek (wood and high elves), and Lendore (aquatic and high elves). Mountain dwarves dominate Irongate and the Principality of Ulek and are numerous in Ratik. The lands of Ulek, Urnst, Sunndi, Highfolk (especially), and the Valley of the Mage (a unique case) are dominated by mixes of demihumans. Veluna has always had a strong population of high elves and gnomes, and the Gran March and Keoland have had their ranks swelled by high elves and mountain dwarves fleeing Geoff and Sterich.

Humans:
Baklunish : The Baklunish people have golden-hued skins, gray-green or green eyes, and hair ranging from dark brown to blue-black. The lands of Ekbir, the Tiger Nomads, Ull, and Zeif around the Drawmij Ocean are home to this pure Baklunish strain. Farther east, racial mixing results in modified appearances: the Wolf Nomads are Baklunish mixed with Flan (from the Rovers of the Barrens), and have correspondingly darker features. In Ket, mixing with both Oeridian and Suloise folk gave rise to folk with pale yellow or golden-brown/tan skin.

Baklunish peoples are of two sorts. The northern branch favors bright patterns and gaudy prints, although their garments are typically a one-piece coverall with whatever additional garb they can add. The southern branch likes parti-colors of a more pastel hue. Their dress is complex and full of many puffs and slashes when adorned for special events. They commonly wear rough hide and cloth when traveling or at war, with shields and banners showing clan colors.

Flannae : The original human occupants of the Flanaess had bronze complexions varying from coppery tones to deep brown. Their eyes were dark brown, even black, or rarely amber. Likewise, their hair was always dark brown or black. The Flan are now scattered to the winds. The Rovers of the Barrens have no land to call their own; the Tenhas, pure Flan and proud of it, are enslaved by Iuz or have fled to the south; the Flan folk of Geoff anf Sterich have likewise fled south and east from their homes. In the Theocracy of the Pale, Flan/Oerid descendants are lighter of skin and hair than pure Flan, and are a handsome people. Perhaps within a handful of generations, almost all Flan blood will be found only in such blends.

Flannae once wore brightly-hued body paints, with yellow ochre and vermilion being the favorites. While the Rovers of the Barrens still use considerable body painting (where their high boots, loincloth and chest and arm leather don't cover them), the more civilized Flan dress in the mode currently fashionable in their portion of the continent. Garments, however, tend to be of solid primary colors, with very bright hues predominant.

Oeridians : The Oeridians have fairly dark skins, varying from tan to olive colors, but their hair color runs the range from honey blond to black, with brown and auburn the most common. Their eye colors are likewise variable. Pure Oeridian stock is thus less easy to spot with the casual eye than most races, but it can be seen most readily in Furyondy, Perrenland, and in the east and south of the Great Kingdom.

Oeridians typically favor checks and plaids. Aerdi and Nyrondal houses tend to wear plaids, while the southern and western Oeridians favor checks, often of a diamond pattern or similar variation from the standard square. Clothing tends towards tight-legged trousers, close-fitting upper garments, and capes or cloaks.

Suloise : The Suel were scattered to the margins of the Flanaess in the distant past, so it is small wonder that most Suel blood has been intermized with other racial groups. The Suel are fairskinned, some being almost albino, with red or blond (even platinum blond) hair and blue, gray, or violet eyes. The barbarian peoples of the northeast are the purest example of original Suel stock, but the Suel also dominate the Scarlet Brotherhood and the eastern islands of the Aerdi Sea. On the main continent, the Duchy of Urnst has the largest (proportionately) enclave of Suloise. Anomalous populations of Suloise are found in Hepmonaland and the Amedio Jungle; while many have developed tanned skins with heavy freckling, pale and albino faces that look utterly incongruous in the steaming jungles can still be seen.

Suloise folk have long used solid colors. Aristocratic houses have two or more such colors in their dress, so parti-colored garments are not uncommon. Similarly, the Suel people tend to favor display of emblems or tokens on their garments, typically of a contrasting color to the basic one. Dress was originally loose panteloons topped by a baggy blouse. This form of dress has been changed to meet the needs of the varying climates, so the northern Suloise barbarians wear furs and skin garments, while those in the southern- most area have replaced the blouse with vest-like upper wear.

Human Racial Mixes: The importance of the racial mixes varies from region to region. The Suloise are the most jealous of their purebloodedness, perhaps reflecting their distinct differences from all other races and their history of being driven out of the main Flanaess lands (by the Oeridians, in particular). The Scarlet Botherhood are Suloise racists, but such racism is rare. Although other groups may take strong pride in being much like their original ancestors, as the Tenhas do, those around them often do not react favorably to this (as reflected in the fall of Tenh). In the central Flanaess in particular, little attention is paid to skin color or racial ancestry, although there is growing tendency to regard Suel folk with suspicion (not least because of the rose of the Scarlet Brotherhood). There are more important divisions within the lands to worry about in these times. Who cares whether the pikeman standing next to you is Oeridian or Baklunish, if the enemy is a hobgoblin or a fiend in the service of Iuz?

Demihumans


Halflings: Halflings typically identify strongly with the good nations of the Flanaess. They are not numerous, and have no lands of their own. It is not surprising that they look to the larger folk (and other demihumans) for protection and alliances.

Gnomes and halflings dress in similar fashion, often replacing their trousers with knee-length britches. The gnomes favor more stolid colors - brown breeks, a tan blouse, green boots and belt, with a dark brown jacket or coat. A halfling in the same garb might have a yellow shirt and top off with a cap of green with a bright yellow feather in it. Both races will often wear striped clothing. When hunting or at war, they likewise favor garb of a curiously mottled sort, with greens and browns intemixed.

Gnomes: Gnomes take a similar view to Halflings. Their hilly homes have been threatened by the humanoids in particular; many have been driven into the plains of human dominated lands where they seek help to re-establish their old heartlands. Many, too, cp-exist with elves in the woodlands; where the elves are active in working with human interests, so are the gnomes. Hill gnomes often share living space with dwarves, and are a brave, tough folk who are loyal to their neighbors and fight side by side with them.

Dwarves: Dwarves of the Flanaess are strong and stubborn people. In some lands, they need help, but are often too proud to ask for it outright; beseiged Irongate, the exiled mountain dwarves driven into the Good Hills of Keoland, and the Ulek dwarves who suffered at the hands of the Pomarj humanoids are all examples. Some of these clans feel themselves to have been wronged; the Ulek dwarves are angry with the elves of Celene for not giving them aid, and these is strain between them and the elven-dominates Duchy of Ulek, which sympathizes with the dwarves and yet dares not rebuke Celene openly. Elsewhere, the strong mountain folk are better placed; in Urnst, which has emerged strong after the war, dwarves are learning that the old glory of Nyrond needs their help even to sustain its own shadow. In Sunndi, the dwarves ally with the elves and gnomes, each experts at defending their own terrains, to keep their enemies at bay.

Dwarven folk love shades of brown, red, and gray contrasted with a bright splash of color and picked out with as much precious metal as they can possibly wear. Leather is a favorite material, with wool being popular also. Dwarves wear clothing similar to that of the Oeridians.

Elves: Elves of the Flanaess are more divided. Bright Veluna has a strong elven presence that works unstintingly for good. Nyrond and Furyondy elves are vigilant against evil. The elves of the Highfolk bow no knee to Iuz, but the rulers of Celene are divided and currently favor isolationism. In Sunndi, the gray elves are warlike, aggressive, and hostile; in Lendore, the dominant high elves are philosophers, mystics, and otherwordly. There is no simple racial division within the elves, either; it is not the case that high elves are more inclined to be actively opposed to the evil of the Flanaess than gray or wood elves. What can one say of this timeless people? Some are the greatest hope of the Flanaess, while some seem to do nothing as the world threatens to collapse about them.

Elves of the Sylvan ilk dress similar to Suloise, except their colors are pale tints of green, fawn, ecru, and dove gray. High elves are similar in mode of apparel, but they add blues, lilacs, and purples to the more natural forest hues of their woodland kin. Hunting and war garments are brown, russet, or tan. Gray elves wear very complex and flowing garb of pure white, sun yellow, silver and gold lame' set off by polished leather of contrasting colors and highlighted by jewels. All elvenkind wear cloaks, especially when traveling. These garments are neutral gray or gray-green.

Humanoids: The humanoid races of the Flanaess have historically been driven into the least favorable areas - mountains, hills, barren plains, swamps, and marshlands. However, three lands are now dominated by them. The Bone March is home to orcs, ogres, and gnolls; the Pomarj is the habitat of the same races, together with bugbears; and the Lost Lands (previously the Grand Duchy of Geoff and Sterich) have been overrun by ogres, giants, hobgoblins, and other humanoids. Iuz, of course, has many humanoids within his lands. There is no common factor that unites these marauding monsters. The orcs of the Pomarj have no alliance and no communication with the orcs of the Bone March, for example. Even the priesthoods of the same orcish deities have virtually no communication. The humanoids are a rabble, but that makes then no less dangerous.
