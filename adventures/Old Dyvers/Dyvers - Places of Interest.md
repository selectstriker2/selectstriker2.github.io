## Gates of Dyvers

The Dyvers city proper has 4 official entrances: The Gate of the Dragon, the Harbor Gate, the Silver Gate and the Sun Gate. The Gate of the Dragon lies at the western end of Dyvers, the Harbor Gate pierces the north wall, the Silver Gate lies in the southeast corner while the Sun Gate gives access to the southern road.

## Gate of the Dragon
The Gate of the Dragon is a huge gate, towering above the city walls with it’s 30 foot height and 20 foot width. At least three strong men are needed to move one of the enormous wooden iron-bound double doors of the gate. At each side of the gate an image of a dragon curves upward, carved from the stone, their snouts almost touching at the apex. The dragons hold the a shield with the device of Dyvers, the tritower, between their snouts. The two round towers that flank are 40 feet high. The Gate of the Dragon was constructed after the destruction of the old gate, the Ferrond Gate, by the great red dragon Lansermius. Special enchantments are laid upon the images of the dragons, which will come to life if called upon in times of need by the Magister, the Archmage or three members of the High Council.

## Harbor Gate
The Harbor Gate is a smallish, worn but busy gate. There is a slight depression in the ground, caused by the many people and carts traversing this gate over the years. A gap with a depth of one foot in the centre separates the ground from the stout wooden doors of the gate. A porticullis has been added to the gate to stop intruders from sneaking under the door. While the other gates have a small one-person door built into them to let people in after nightfall, this gate is completely cost at night. The harbor gate is but 15 feet high and 20 feet wide. Ships of all sorts and sizes are carved into the stone above the gate. The two square towers flanking the gate measure 40 feet.

## Silver Gate
The Silver gate is a clean, ordinary gate, under a good state of repair. It is 20 feet high and 20 feet wide, having excellent wooden, iron bound doors. At both sides of the gates flowing lines are set into the wall, culminating at the top into a huge silver bar, measuring four feet long and one foot wide, set into the stone of the gate. This silver was garnered in a freak find of a cluster of silver veins several miles south-east of Dyvers some 80 years ago. This provided a boost to the economy during that period. The mines are now as good as depleted, although some foolhardy prospectors still search for new veins. The silver lines and the bar are real, and collectively worth over 5,000 gp. They are treated with a avoidance spell of 20th lvl, however, and the guards always keep a good watch. Continual faerie fire lights the silver lines at night.

## Sun Gate
The Sun gate is a small, well traversed gate leading to the southern roads. It is built completely within a huge square tower, and the gate itself is only 15 feet high and 15 feet wide. It’s door are cast from solid bronze, and very heavy. They are cleaned daily, to keep a bas relief depicting a sun shining brightly. It is lighted at night by directed continual light spells.

## Other Gates
Other gates in Dyvers itself are the Warriors Gate, with two iron warriors (statues) at both sides of the gate, ceremoniously holding their weapons and the smaller Festival Gate, where processions once entered the city. These gates are closed only in times of emergency. The two iron warriors from the Warriors Gate do not suffer from rust, creating all kinds of wild speculation about some magical origin.

## The Walls of Dyvers

Dyvers has two types of city walls, the wall that protects the northern part of Dyvers is called the old wall. It dates back to the time that Dyvers was the provincial capital of the Viceroyalty of Ferrond, now Furyondy. The new city wall encompasses the southern part of the city, and is relatively new, standing now for a little over 50 years.

### Old Wall
The old city walls of Dyvers are 15 feet wide and 20 feet high. They are constructed of sturdy stone, but in need of repair in some places. Mosses, lichens and weeds grow on the large parts of the walls and as a result they are often moist and slippery at the inside, making climbing them difficult. Buildings have to be built at at least 15 feet from away the walls, and the space between the walls and the houses is used by city guard patrols to quickly traverse the city. Special torch brackets hold three torches each 50 feet along the wall. Guards will pass each point on a wall about once each turn. Permanent guard posts are situated the towers. Where the old city walls meet those of the new city, the restrictions are lifted, but patrols are still there, many emerging from the Law Tower, which is part of the Courts.

### New Wall
The new city wall is only 10 feet wide and 20 feet high, but of much better construction and in a better state of repair. It is only about 50 years old, while the other wall is reaching 3 centuries. Torch brackets are set here every 30 feet. Patrols pass each point every 5 rounds.

### D1 - The Twin Towers
Residence

Description: Situated at the Obsidian Square, these twin towers raise to a heigth of 60 feet, and are, individually, about 20 feet across. The towers are made of a blackish-blue smooth unknown kind of stone, and are fused at the bottom, while having seperate pinnacles.
People: Two mages make there home at the twin towers, Alheera and her twin brother Algharon. Alheera is 9th level and a specialist conjurer, while her brother is an generic mage of 8th level. They are both in their thirties. Algharon has an apprentice, which sometimes stays at his tower. Alheera is the spokeswoman for the two. They sometimes take on an odd job or two from adventurers.
Travellers Lore: Alheera is suspected to be slightly insane, and to conjure up monsters from time to time, that she likes to let loose on the city. Algharon watches over her in this respect, and battles any escaped monsters.
DM’s Notes: Alheera is indeed slightly insane. She is also looking for an apprentice. She never speaks about what happened to the last one. Algharon is desperately in search of a cure for his sister's affliction, and will reward adventurers handsomely for possible cures. It is up to the DM to invent the cause (and possible remedies) for Alheera’s affliction.

### V1 - The Midnight Tower
Landmark

Description: This tower is about 30 foot across and rises 70 feet in the air. The structure is made from blackened crumbling limestone bricks and has a flat top. It's only visible entrance is a marred, rune encrypted steel portal.
People: No people are known to inhabit the Midnight Tower.
Travellers Lore: The Midnight tower has stood in Dyvers as long as people can remember. It seems to always have had it's crumbling appearance, but the stone is surprisingly tough and the tower never seems to deteriorate further. People going in there are said to never have returned from here, although some people have exited from the tower from time to time, often speaking strange languages and wearing strange clothes.
DM’s Notes: The Midnight Tower is a magical construct. The tower itself is only a shell, while the interior travels through space and time, and if one day passes inside, one year passes in Dyvers. (Or some other period, at the DM’s discretion). If one steps out of the tower before a day has passed, they will arrive at another locale entirely. (Where exactly is up to the DM) The door of the tower can only be forced open at midnight, and only for one turn, whereafter the interior shifts to another time and place. Otiluke has been seen entering the tower once, many years ago. Who created the tower and for what purpose seems to have been lost in time. The tower’s effects are known to some knowledgable people in the city, who tend keep the knowledge for themselves.

Dyvers is a city that revolves around the constant flow of trade. Should this flow ever dry up, the consequences for the city and its inhabitants would be severe. The city’s leadership is well aware of this dependency, and they consider enabling free and continued trade their top priority. The Greyhawk wars have both destroyed old and created new trading opportunities. The overall level of trade has dropped somewhat nonetheless, and lean times are ahead. In addition to this the comes increasing pressure from Belvor and Furyondian nobility to divert funds to them in addition to the regular taxes and tithes. Dyvers is prepared to aid them to some extend, as it does not want Iuz spreading any more to the south, but the city is operating on limited resources. Now that (relative) peace reign the land again, reestablishing trade routes is of utmost importance, for where there’s trade, there’s profit.

## Shipping and Handling

A major function of any trading center is the (re)distribution of goods, and Dyvers is no different in that respect. Many goods that are neither produced nor used in Dyvers pass through the city. The docks are always bustling with activity, with cargo ships being loaded and unloaded. Many merchant caravans pass on their goods to other merchants and so on. As a result of this activity, Dyvers contains many warehouses, yards and markets. A multitude of professions and businesses that support this activity are also present, for example: there are the people who load and unload the goods, those who produce packaging materials such as crates, rope, barrels etc., those who produce, repair or manage means of transportation such as carts, rafts, oxen etc. and those who record all the handling that is taking place, such as clerks and accountants.

## Mercenaries

If Greyhawk is a city dominated by mages and priests (and especially by thieves, many a Dyverian citizen will say) then Dyvers is a city dominated by warriors. Many mercenaries and hirelings flock to the free city to seek employ and their prospective employers do likewise. Dyvers status as free city is important to the mercenary trade, as it enables the city to contain many mercenary companies of differing nationalities (and allegiances) without causing a political upheaval. Again, the city’s leadership considers unhindered trade (of any kind) a top priority, and the mercenary business is just another trade to them. They do keep a close watch so as to prevent any mercenary company from threatening the continued independence of the city and they take care that conflicts between different mercenary companies are being resolved outside of the city proper. As with shipping and handling, many businesses that cater to the mercenary trade can be found in Dyvers: weapon and armor shops, outfitters, training facilities and schools for the arts of war and combat, inns, taverns, gambling dens and the like.

## Banking

Banking is a form of business that has only gained prominence in Dyvers the last few decades. Due to its position as a trade city, there was a serious need to regulate the flow of funds. A great trade city needs moneychangers to exchange currencies for proper barter. Trading caravans and ships often carry a great financial risk with them, and financing them is a serious business. A lot of secondary professions also arose from these needs: insurance agencies, bounty hunters to collect on loans gone bad, accountants to do the paperwork, appraisers for judging the value of foreign barter. Most of these trades where present in Dyvers in one form or another for many years, the recent upsurge is a sign that a certain degree professionalism has crept into the business. (The banking business remains largely unlike our 20th century counterpart, however.)

## Festivals

Dyvers is famed for the many festivals and conventions that take place there each year. During these periods, the city is often thronged with outsiders. Many people take long journeys to be present at one of Dyver’s great festivals. The sheer enormity and variety of entertainment present during these festivals even awes some more seasoned travelers. Most travelling circuses, shows, and other entertainers make a stop in Dyvers sometime in their career, if not each year. Next to entertainment, food and drinks of all sorts can be had, either exotic fare or the more common varieties. There is work for minstrels, bards and actors, sellers of trinkets and momentoes, costumes of all kinds can be bought, there are many places to stay and celebrate; inns, hostelries, taverns etc. These activities generate enough wealth to keep the local thieves’ guild alive and well, despite the efforts of those who enforce the law in Dyvers. Some people also deem Festivals a good time to settle old scores, as the city guard has its hands more than full during these periods, so next to merrymaking, intrigue is also abundant.

## Shipbuilding

Having a good natural harbor and access to many important waterways, Dyvers became an improtant site for shipbuilding. Most shipbuilding facilities lie along the river, in an area called the Wharfs. Although not known for their innovative qualities, the shipbuilders of Dyvers are praised for the reliability of their vessels. It is a rare captain who outlives a ship from Dyvers, the saying goes. It speaks for itself that a lot of attendant trades, such as those who make ropes, stitch sails and make nails are also abundant. Dyvers gets most of its wood from the Gnarley forest, and is somewhat at odds over this practice with that forest’s inhabitants. Forested areas once surrounded Dyvers and even grew right up to the bank of the Velverdyva River. Most of these trees have been chopped down and used as construction material or firewood. Although Dyvers has learned not to rely on wood shipments from the Gnarley that heavily, logging is still abundant at its edges.

## Woodcarving

Dyvers is also well known for the skill of its woodcutters. Nowadays a business of a much smaller scale than those mentioned above, it no longer has a dominating place in the city’s economy. Many gifted artists still spend their days carving beautiful decorations into many kinds of wood, however. These decorations can appear on art objects, such as wooden figurines, but also on furniture, doors and windows, and even tools. What is true for shipbuilding is also true for this profession, although more (especially rare woods) wood is imported and less is taken from the Gnarley.

## Guilds

As a trade city, Dyvers possesses many different guilds. Some are more organized than others, and not all businesses have a guild associated with them. It is not required by law for anyone who wants to start a particular business to join a guild, but guild membership is encouraged by the city’s rulership. In their opinion guilds improve communication between the merchants and the city administration and they can perform some functions that improve trade. Such functions can include quality control, a form of insurance, as other guild members can step in for a member who suddenly gets sick etc. Depending on their wealth and type of organisation some guilds have a seperate guildhouse, where they conduct much of their activities. Other guilds are less structured, and often rent a room if a meeting between members is scheduled.

## Founding a new guild
Those who want to found a new guild have to acquire permission from the city administration first. They have to deliver an application where the purpose of the guild, the rules by which its members are bound and its initial membership is summed up. If this application meets the approval of the city administration, a special charter is given. Those guilds that are founded without a proper charter are known as rogue guilds. There are currently a few rogue guilds inside the city, the thieves guild the most prominent among them. Members of these rogue guilds are persecuted by the city’s law enforcement.

## Guild membership
Each guild sets its own requirements for membership. These requirements differ from an entrance fee or a yearly membership fee to intensive pre-investigations, agreeing to regular unannounced quality control, making oaths to certain gods or displaying certain signs or symbols at the members’ place of business.

## Taxes

As important as it is for the city to keep the trade flowing, it is also important to generate enough revenues to pay the city officials and keep the infrastructure in good condition. Tax collectors (usually accompanied by a DGP - see Law & Order) tour the city all year round. Their black uniforms have given them the nickname "ravens" and they are not a welcome sight to the merchants and businessmen of the city. Tax fraud is certainly present in Dyvers, although large-scale tax evasions are rare.

### Income Tax
Every resident has to pay 10% income tax, with a minimum of 2 gp. each year. Tax sheets will be sent out to citizens throughout the year, one each year. On these sheet the taxee must write down the amount of income, and the tax he has to pay. The correctness of this will be checked only incidentally (except for suspected evaders). Taxes can be paid at the Law Tower, the City Administration Building or the Treasury, or one can ask for tax collector to collect it at the door. Whenever taxes are overdue, a tax collector goes door to door, and charges an extra fee of 1 gp. for each month overdue in addition to a 1% interest.

### Wealth Tax
If one's wealth exceeds 5,000 gp. an extra tax of 0.5% of the total wealth is levied annually.

### Gate Tax
At each crossing of a gate, 1 cp. per head or wheel must be paid. It is possible to buy a gate permit for 1 gp. Such a permit gives the holder unlimited access to Dyvers, free from Gate Tax for a total of three years.

### Property Tax
For each 25 square feet of property owned, an annual tax of 1 sp. is levied.

### Traveler’s Tax
Travelers carrying goods travelling into Dyvers, while not being citizens, can be made to pay travelers' tax. This tax is 1% for most base goods, such as metals, foodstuffs, wood and similar products, 5% for luxuries, crafted items and gemstones, and 10% for weaponry, armor, and magic items. This tax is not levied if someone wants to enter Dyvers without the intention of selling any of the goods they carry. Anybody found out selling products in Dyvers without having paid traveler’s' tax, must pay double the indicated amount or have his items confiscated.

### Services Tax
Travelers are also sometimes asked to pay a services tax. This tax is meant to supply funds to support the guard, upkeep of roads, and other public services that foreigners also enjoy. Service tax are usually levied when the city is in need of extra money on short notice, and can be levied several times each year on all non-citizens travelling through Dyvers. Depending on the need of the city, and the tax collectors' estimation of the traveler’s wealth the tax usually ranges from 1 sp. to 10 gp.
