# A Path Less Travelled

## Blurb

The summer festival of Berries is in full swing in the halfling village of Banebridge. That is until a Farhlangun priest that was expected has not shown up.
The Mayor of Banebridge, a halfling Kerrick Goblinsbane, has requested that the party venture in to the Gnarley to find the lost cleric and escort him to the festival.

A Greyhawk Reborn 1-Round outdoor adventure set in the Gnarley Forest for characters level 1-4
Part 2 of the Reclamation of the Gnarley story arc.

## Adventure Background

The Festival of Berries started several years ago after some enterprising young halflings, _Zeke and Tess Greenbottle_, started a berry farm on the outskirts of Banebridge. The following harvest was
bountiful and the couple invited the townsfolk out for a grand party where they shared in the mounds of fresh picked berries. It was at that first party that _Wellard Istarn_, Cleric of Farhlangun,
attended after helping a group of weary party guests fix their wagon along the road out of Maraven. Grateful for his help, the halflings invited him to the next years festival as their honored guest.

The search for _Wellard Istarn_ begins on the Eastern Gnarley Road. There are several Gnarley Ranger stations along the path, but few travellers go through the Gnarley these days, what with the
remnants of Turrosh Mak's horde clustered into small tribes to the south.

The cleric found his way to help some of the Gnarley Rangers near Southgate work their way through the tribal areas of the southern Gnarley to bring the _Ranger Commander Illum Greyshard_ news of
an unnatural disease infecting much of the southern Gnarley and even into Southgate. The Knights there are as perplexed as the Rangers as to the source of the disease. The people of Southgate hope
to employ the wisdom of the Gnarley Druids to ascertain the source of the disease and hopefully a cure.

On their way through the woods, the group encountered a large orc raiding party. The rangers fought off many of the orcs in an effort to help _Wellard Istarn_ escape. He ran for many miles, given
strength and stamina by Farhlangun, but eventually ran afoul of (some strange creature) which captured him and brought him to its lair.

    * Zeke and Tess Greenbottle
        * Halfling couple in their mid 30's
        * Renowned berry growers
    * Kerrick Goblinsbane
        * Halfing male in his 40's

    You've come to Banebridge for the Festival of Berries. Held at the Greenbottle Farm, the festival attracts people of all kinds from the area. The special guest is to be _Wellard Istarn_ Cleric of
    Farhlangun. You and your companions were welcomed as if you were family, shown a table, provided an excellent meal, and some of the best wildberry wine. 

    "Welcome to Banebridge my friends." A stout halfling in his 40's approaches your table, an enormouse smile on his face. "I'm Kerrick Goblinsbane, mayor of this humble village. It is an honor and
    a pleasure to have you all visiting us and sharing with us the bounty of the harvest. Enjoy the food and the entertainment, I must go and see if I can find our special guest." With that he turns
    on his heel, and briskly walks off towards a large group of people.

    To your left, a stage to be used by the upcoming entertainers is being assembled. 

As the sun begins to set, the mayor approaches the party. He looks exasperated, several beads of sweat drip from his brow and he is out of breath.

    I hate to bother you fine folks, but you look like adventurers and I'm afraid something might have happened to our special guest. He was set to arrive several hours ago, but he hasn't arrived.
    His last missive said that he was attendign to some business in Southgate and that he may have to cut through the Gnarley to make it here in time. A local woodsman did say that several of the
    woodland birds identified a group of orcs pursuing a man in brown robes and several rangers deep in the Gnarley this afternoon, but they lost track of the man.

    Could you see your way to take the Gnarley Road and help find our lost traveller? We don't have much, but I'm sure we could collect a suitable token of our thanks. _Nellond_ here could
    lead you as far as Willowbend if it would help. 

## The Eastern Gnarley

Assuming the party elects to help, they can make their way down the road, turning right at the fork, heading towards Willowbend.

    Taking the right path, you follow the Gnarley Road west towards Willowbend. You pass several small halfling carts being pulled by ponies, the carts laden with forest mushrooms, ferns, and other
    forest flora. As you/your guide turns around a bend, a group of goblins, covered in an oily black substance, pop out from behind several downed trees.

    "Drop your valuables where you stand and run away!" the tallest one yells out in a high pitched voice.

The players have a few moments to consider what they will do
    * intimidate the goblins, who will run away if anyone makes a DC 12 intimidate

If no one does anything, one of the goblins goes beserk and several warriors charge the characters, shortswords in hand

### Combat Encounter

APL 2: 6 Goblins + Goblin Leader
APL 3: 8 Goblins + Goblin Leader
APL 4: 8 Goblins + Goblin Leader (all +1 to hit, 6 more hp)

#### Tactics

The goblins are hoping to grab anything valuable they can and run back off into the forest. While they pretend to be fieroceous, they are quite cowardly and will flee back to a small cove of trees
a half mile deeper into the forest, where the rest of their compatriots are. They also have several female goblins tending to several small huts, and several kids play around a small fire.

#### Terrain
This area has several downed trees along the path that the goblins were planning on using for cover as they pelt the characters with shortbows. The goblin leader will hurl ray of frost at the party
from a distance to slow them down.

Any area past 5ft off the path is treated as difficult terrain and the trees can be climbed on top of (5ft above the path)

## Willowbend

After the encounter with the goblins, the party continues on to Willowbend, where the party encounters several battered Gnarley Rangers, covered in cuts and bandages.

Talking with them reveals that they were part of the group from Southgate.

    * _Wellard Istarn_ was with them up until several hours ago. They were sneaking through orc territory near the ruins of Tricaster when they were spotted by an orc scout and chased through
    the woods. The cleric, with his divine abilities, ran ahead of them as they fended off the orc patrol.
    * They expected to meet up with him here in Willowbend, but have not since seen him.
    * They can provide the party directions to follow their path back to where they lost contact with _Wellard_. It should be far enough away from the orcs that they shouldn't pose to much of
    a problem.
    * They indicate that it is vital that _Wellard_ is found and escorted back to Willowbend.
    * They are too injured to guide the party, but they do have some minor scrolls/potions they can give the party to aid them in their search.
    * They explain that the path they followed is rarely used except by some of the rangers familiar with the area.
    * "A Path Less Travelled" is often safer for those trying to cross through the Gnarley, as the orcs travel the known/easy paths.

The characters are able to purchase supplies (from the PHB) as well as some potions while in Willowbend.

## A Path Less Travelled

With guidance from the Gnarley Rangers, the party can follow a seemingly hidden path south of Willowbend that heads deeper into the forest.
The signs marking the trail are simple enough to spot, if you know what you are looking for.

After another hour, the party reaches the spot where the rangers last saw _Wellard_. The party can search around the area for tracks, signs of disturbances, etc. Allow the players to think
about what skills they have and how they might find the trail.
