APL 2-4

### Overview
The party is meeting with a representative of an organization that is looking to hire them to investigate a missing shipment of lumber that was expected over a week ago.
Construction on an important building will soon be halted if the lumber is not received.

The party sets off from Dyvers into the Gnarley Forest, where they meet a squad of Gnarley Rangers and share camp with them on the road. 
The Rangers can answer any questions the party might have regarding what is happening in the area. The lumber mill they are heading too is outside of what this squad has patrolled, but they can say that they have seen increased orc warband activity in the Gnarley as of late.

The next morning the party sets off towards the lumber mill. They come across the remains of an orc hunting party that has been beset by some strange creature.
	
	1. If the group spends enough time investigating the carnage, the creature returns and attacks the party.
	2. If the group continues on, they encounter another orc hunting party and can either fight or negotiate.

After the encounter, the party continues on to the lumber camp.
