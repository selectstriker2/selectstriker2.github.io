# The Corrupted
A corrupted creature is one that has been warped and twisted by the Death Crystals - jet black crystals from the Abyss seeded by deranged followers of Tharizdun

The crystals rewrite the creature's mind and body, making some creatures simply feral or insane and mutating the bodies of others. Intelligent creatures can gain demonic powers.
