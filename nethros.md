# Zarina (Zeylissa) Mos'tai of House Arksturn, Nethrosian Hremdar of Velmar - Eastern City of the Nethrosian Confederation

For centuries we have lived beneath the surface, not knowing what came of the surface world after the Great Calamity.
For centuries some of us have suffered from an uncurable disease, forcing our society to segregate us from the rest of the population,
in fear of the terrible ramifications of a wide spread outbreak.

Separated from our families, we spend our endless days in the Hremdells training in the art of war, to defend our cities from the dark denizens of the deep darkness.
We spend our sleepless nights praying to the Ancestors and studying the ancient texts of our people, hoping to discover the secret to our Ascension.

Those people not infected reach their Ascension as simply a passage of time, why must we suffer the endless existance of this physical world, or to simply die,
preventing the process of Ascension altogether.

This question is one I cannot answer here, my mind constrained behinds these obsidian walls. I must return to the lands of my ancestors, before they fled underground,
where I pray to find a cure for this malady once and for all.
I do not know what, if anything, I will find once I leave the perimeter of the city - this grand haven of my people. I do not know if I will find an answer, or if some unknown creature will slay
me, forever imprisoning me to this world.

But I must try, for what other choice do I have?
