Dyvers CY598

The two day Battle for Dyvers resulted in a victory for the free people of Dyvers, but the victory came at a very high price.
Over half of the city lies in ruins, destroyed by Turrosh Mak's horde. The green dragon of the Gnarley "Chaustichlorinus" laid waste to most of the Royal District
before raiding the treasure at the Grand Cathedral of Zilchus and fleeing back to its home deep in the Gnarley.

Most of the Gentry either fled the city or died in the assault, leaving much of the governing body in disarray. Magister Hunter has organized a small council
of the remaining Gentry to organize the military, manage rebuilding efforts in critical areas of the city, and call for assistance from Furyondy and Veluna.
Upstart families have petitioned to fill in the missing Gentry positions, and the competition is heating up.

The reduced City Watch numbers have made it difficult to maintain the peace, and the seedier areas of town have seen a rise in street gang activity.
What remains of the Dyvers Free Army have taken to assisting the City Watch where they are able.
To handle some of the more benign issues, the Watch has taken to hiring adventurers.

The Arcanum College has closed its doors to any and all outsiders, and reports of a great release of arcane energy from within the tower at the beginning
of the battle has independent memebers of the Dyvers Mages Guild investigating.

Rangers of the Gnarley have moved most of the denizens of the Gnarley to the outskirts of the forest where they can be better protected. They too have been
looking to recruit adventurers to venture into sections of the forest to retrieve residents of small communities that have lost contact.

A week after the battle, a mercenary company funded by a group out of Greyhawk has taken control of Eastguard and Maraven, increasing tension
between the two cities.
